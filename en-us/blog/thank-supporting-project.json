Developers are supporting the war without violence in our own ways. By 17:00 Jan 27, 2020,\n2823 confirmed, 5794 suspected, 55 cured cases and 81 death were reported all over the country. It was a tough situation.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/blog/media/thank-supporting-project-1.webp\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>According to the reports on 2019-nCov, supplies in Wuhan and nearby counties have been insufficient. However, public health incidents are well-acknowledged as one of the most complicated public incidents given that the difficulty in the arrangement and the length\nof the incidents. With the help of <font color=#FF0000>digital information platforms</font>, the efficiency of communication among suppliers and demanders through distributed and automatic interfaces would largely improve. Besides, due to the difference between the current info collection approach and the existing publication platforms, data was largely dispersed and a large amount of picture information is very ineffective in real-time communication. Hence, the project aims at <font color=#FF0000 >unifying the information collected by different departments, reporting real-time data through open-source and distributed collaboration and connecting different parties through the digital platform. The central idea of the project is to collect information from the open public. After verification, the data collected will be pushed into the code repository with the source of the data.</font> We are trying our best to ensure the authenticity of the original data and meet the regularities.
